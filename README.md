# Elasticsearch to dbt Connector

This Python script serves as a connector between Elasticsearch and dbt (data build tool), allowing you to fetch data from Elasticsearch, perform basic transformations, and load the transformed data into a dbt-compatible data store.

### Overview:

Elasticsearch is a powerful distributed search and analytics engine commonly used for storing and querying large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data. dbt is a popular tool for managing data transformation and modeling workflows in a structured, version-controlled manner.

This connector script bridges the gap between Elasticsearch and dbt, enabling you to integrate Elasticsearch data into your dbt modeling and transformation pipelines seamlessly.

### How it Works:

1. **Fetching Data from Elasticsearch**:
   - The script connects to an Elasticsearch instance and executes a query to fetch data from a specified index.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - After fetching data from Elasticsearch, the script performs basic transformations on the data as needed. This may include filtering, aggregation, or restructuring of the data.

3. **Loading Data into dbt-Compatible Data Store**:
   - Once the data is transformed, the script initializes a dbt client and inserts the transformed data into a dbt-compatible data store using SQL queries.

4. **Routine Checks Integration**
   - Real-time monitoring of Elasticsearch queries allows for proactive identification and resolution of performance issues; we can push Exabyte-scale with minimal sharding ...

### Prerequisites:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. Elasticsearch instance with data indexed and accessible.
3. dbt installed and configured with appropriate profiles and targets.

### Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Modify the script:
   - Update the Elasticsearch configuration variables (`ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`, `ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX`, `ELASTICSEARCH_QUERY`) to match your Elasticsearch setup.
   - Modify the data transformations as needed in the script.

3. Run the script: python elasticsearch_to_dbt_connector.py

4. Verify the data:
- Check the dbt-compatible data store to ensure that the transformed data has been loaded successfully.

### Customization:

Feel free to customize the script to suit your specific use case and requirements. You can extend the script to handle more complex transformations, error handling, and authentication mechanisms as needed.

### Contributing:

Contributions to improve the script or documentation are welcome. Please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
